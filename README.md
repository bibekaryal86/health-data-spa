# health-data-spa

This is the front end application for saving and viewing personal health data, esp test results. More information about
the purpose of the app is included in the back end application: https://github.com/bibekaryal86/health-data-java.

This app uses React/Redux/Typescript/Webpack/Babel/Eslint/Prettier/Jest, and is served from the client.

The app is one of the two repos used to save-retrieve-display data:

* https://github.com/bibekaryal86/health-data-java (save/retrieve data)
* https://github.com/bibekaryal86/health-data-spa (view data) (this)

This app is deployed in AWS Amplify. AWS Amplify makes it very easy to deploy React based app from its website by
connecting directly to GitHub. The only configuration required is the `amplify.yml` file in the project root - but even
this is optional and needed only to override the build settings provided by default in the Amplify page.

The app is deployed at:
* AWS Amplify: URL-LINK-HERE
